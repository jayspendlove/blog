Here I list the edits that I make to the tutorial after writing the full Jupyter notebook to markdown
- remove title 
- remove code blocks annotated to not include in final post
- add a table of contents
- push repo changes to Github (at least the images folder). Then change all png links from local 
paths to links to the images on Github. The links must be to the image opened in it's own tab. 
Something like "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/..."
